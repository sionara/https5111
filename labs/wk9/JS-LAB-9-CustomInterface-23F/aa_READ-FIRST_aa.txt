Hi There!
Cookies and AJAX typically interact with an online web server.
To run these exercises and labs, it is best to use your online hosting for these files.
If you do not have online hosting, use one of the two options below.

========== SERVE THESE FILES FROM A WEB SERVER, EITHER ONLINE HOSTING OR THROUGH A LOCAL SERVER. =====

== ONLINE HOSTING ==
1. FTP these files to your hosting.
2. As you work, save your files and upload the newly saved versions.
3. Refresh your browser.

== THROUGH A LOCAL SERVER ==
You can use Apache if you have it installed, but the simplest way is through VS Code.
TO RUN THESE FILES ON A LOCAL SERVER WITH VS CODE...
1. With VS Code open, use the explorer to select the folder with the lab/demo files.
2. Select one of the HTML files, then click Go Live in the blue bottom info bar.
